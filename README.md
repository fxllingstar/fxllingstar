I like building complex systems, experimenting with mechanics,
and creating worlds both in code and in games.

QOTD:
“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often. Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.”

(Side note: I do **NOT** wear glasses in real life)
