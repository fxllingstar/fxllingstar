👤 About Me

Hi! I’m Max — a self-taught full-stack developer who loves building systems, experimenting with mechanics, and creating worlds both in code and in games.
I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think bigger: real-time systems, app architecture, APIs, game tools, and anything that mixes creativity with engineering.

🚀 What I Work On

Fireside — a real-time chat & social app

-Tools and utilities for Minecraft and other games
-Backend systems using Node.js, WebSockets, security & authentication
-Experiments in UI/UX and app flows

I like combining function + design — making things feel good, not just work.

Sidenotes: 
I do **NOT** wear glasses in real life.

QOTD:
Without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods. - Aristotle
